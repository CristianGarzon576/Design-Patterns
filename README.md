# Design-Patterns
This is a repo to make a references about the Design Patterns

## Creationals
Creational design patterns provide various object creation mechanisms, which increase flexibility and reuse of existing code.

### Builder
Is used to create complex object step by step.
- Can use a Director class to make a predefined elements.

## Estructural
Assemble objects and classes into larger structures, while keeping these structures flexible and efficient.

### Decorator
Lets you attach new behaviors to objects by placing these objects inside special wrapper objects that contain the behaviors.

### Adapter
Allows objects with incompatible interfaces to collaborate.


## Behavioral
Concerned with algorithms and the assignment of responsibilities between objects.

### Strategy
Lets you define a family of algorithms, put each of them into a separate class, and make their objects interchangeable.
- Using a Context class, that alows change the strategy to excecute strategies (algoritms).
