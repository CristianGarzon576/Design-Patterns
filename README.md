# Design-Patterns
This is a repo to make a references about the Design Patterns

## Creationals
Creational design patterns provide various object creation mechanisms, which increase flexibility and reuse of existing code.

### Builder
Is used to create complex object step by step.
- Can use a Director class to make a predefined elements.

## Structural
Assemble objects and classes into larger structures, while keeping these structures flexible and efficient.

### Decorator
Lets you attach new behaviors to objects by placing these objects inside special wrapper objects that contain the behaviors.

### Adapter
Allows objects with incompatible interfaces to collaborate.
 
### Facade
Provides a simplified interface to a library, a framework, or any other complex set of classes.

### Bridge
Lets you split a large class or a set of closely related classes into two separate hierarchies—abstraction and implementation—which can be developed independently of each other.

## Behavioral
Concerned with algorithms and the assignment of responsibilities between objects.

### Strategy
Lets you define a family of algorithms, put each of them into a separate class, and make their objects interchangeable.
- Using a Context class, that alows change the strategy to excecute strategies (algoritms).
